# MWPointTracker

MWPointTracker is a Chrome browser extension for MakerWorld creators that displays total of downloads and prints for each model on a maker's profile page. The formula used corresponds to NumberOfDownloads + NumberOfPrints * 2 and it's displayed on the web page next to the prints and download counters.

When a model is two events away from the next point reward, the total will be shown in orange. If it's one event away, it will be shown in red.
