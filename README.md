# MWPointTracker
![image](images/icon-128.png)

MWPointTracker is a Chrome browser extension for MakerWorld creators that displays total points earned by each model on a maker's profile page. The formula used corresponds to NumberOfDownloads + NumberOfPrints * 2 and it's displayed on the web page next to the prints and download counters.

When a model is two points away from the next point reward, the points total will be shown in orange. If it's one point away, it will be shown in red.
